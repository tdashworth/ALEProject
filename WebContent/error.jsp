<p>Something has gone wrong. Ideally, we'd tell you what and perhaps suggest how to correct the problem. Maybe we'd leave you on the original page so you could correct things there.<p>
<p>Since we've sent you off to this (generic) page, we should give you a way to get back into the system... but there's no way back, because this page was developed as an afterthought.</p>

</div>
<p>Customers (yours; your client's) will already be annoyed when they see a page like this; don't ignore that.</p>
